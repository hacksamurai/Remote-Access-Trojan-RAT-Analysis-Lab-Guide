# 🐀 Remote Access Trojan (RAT) Analysis Lab

This project documents the setup and execution of a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) simulation lab using **Kali Linux** and **Windows 10** virtual machines in an isolated environment.  
It is designed for cybersecurity learners to understand how a RAT behaves, how it communicates, and how to detect and analyze its activity.

## 🔧 Lab Components

- **Attacker VM:** Kali Linux (Metasploit, Wireshark)
- **Victim VM:** Windows 10 (Sysinternals, Wireshark)
- **Payloads:** `msfvenom` Meterpreter (basic and AV-evading versions)
- **Network:** Internal/Isolated virtual network (no internet access)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Generate and deliver a custom RAT payload
- Simulate victim-side infection and interaction
- Monitor and analyze RAT behavior using system and network tools
- Document indicators of compromise (IOCs)
